# Automated-Border-Security-System
Our project is about automating the border security system,so that our country India gets more effective security and the risk to life at the border reduces further. This includes having cameras at the border,along with motion sensors which detect any kind of disturbance,move in the direction of motion and send pictures of it via email to the control room,thus alerting the armed forces.(A buzzer sounds at the control room ) The area of disturbance gets highlighted by brighter lights...                                     We also have bluetooth controlled army tanks,which gets used when the situation gets worse.. Apart from that we have automatic lighting system... Which works with LDR  to light up when dark.
